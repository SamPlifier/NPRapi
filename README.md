# Assignment from The Iron Yard, Front End Engineering (Durham)
## Fall 2016


Practice using Handlebars, JavaScript, jQuery, ajax and the open API from NPR. *I own none of the content provided by National Public Radio and am completely unaffiliated with them. Their open API was among a list of suggestions needed to complete the assignment.*  

The content requires loading over https so, if you wish to view the results as pictured below, you may clone the repo (and open the html file.) Otherwise, clicking on TED or MUSIC will only show an error in the dev tools. If I had the time, I would have made an error print to the page when/if the content were undeliverable.
